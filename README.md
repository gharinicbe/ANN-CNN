Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This repository contains a PowerPoint (PPT) presentation and accompanying Python code to explain the fundamental concepts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The presentation and code cover various aspects of both ANN and CNN, including basic architectures, calculations, gradient issues, convolution, pooling, normalization, and more. Additionally, practical demonstrations using the MNIST Fashion Dataset (for ANN) and the MNIST Digit Recognition Dataset (for CNN) are provided to illustrate these concepts.

Contents
Presentation: The PowerPoint presentation covering the basic concepts of ANN and CNN. The slides provide clear explanations, diagrams, and examples to help you understand the key ideas.

The PPT explains concepts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) supported by the MNIST Fashion Dataset for ANN python codeing and the MNIST Digit Recognition Dataset for CNN python coding.
The PPT covers:

ANN
Basic feedforward neural network architecture.
Calculation of weighted sum and bias in the neuron.
Backpropagation and gradient descent.
Handling vanishing and exploding gradients.

CNN
Basic convolutional neural network architecture.
Convolution operation and filter calculations.
Padding calculations and their impact.
Various types of pooling and their importance.
Batch normalization and dropout techniques.
Usage
Download the repository to your local machine using git clone or by clicking the "Download ZIP" button.

Open the presentation file presentation.pptx to gain an understanding of the concepts. Each slide explains different aspects of ANN and CNN with visual aids and explanations.
